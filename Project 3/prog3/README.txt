All provided files have been successfully encoded and decoded. The encoded files that I created have been
verified with diff against the encoded versions provided in the assignment description. The decoded files have been verified with
diff against the orginal files provided by the assignment description. All test files are included in the test directory. The file 
named testsREADME.txt contains more information testing that was done. The submitted file ./prog3.tgz successfully passed the submission
tester and was generated by command (tar czvf prog3.tgz ./) as seen in the Makefile.

Files named out-(filename) are the encoded versions of the files and files named decoded-(filename) are the decoded versions of the
files. Additional testing was done on the functions that generated the dictonary with the use of print statements to compare against the
output shown in the assignment description. gdb was also used incrementally throughout the implementation of this project for testing
 correctness of values.
