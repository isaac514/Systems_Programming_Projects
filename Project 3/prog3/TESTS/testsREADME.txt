Files named out-(filename) are the encoded versions of the files and files named decoded-(filename) are the decoded versions of the
files. Additional testing was done on the functions that generated the dictonary with the use of print statements to compare against the
output shown in the assignment description. gdb was also used incrementally throughout the implementation of this project for testing
 correctness of values.
